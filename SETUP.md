# Quick Setup Guide

**Complete Backend Structure**
- Node.js/Express server with MongoDB integration
- User management system with medical profiles
- Health log system for voice transcriptions
- RESTful API with full CRUD operations
- Sample data generation script

**Database Models**
- `User`: Stores user profiles, medical history, device IDs
- `HealthLog`: Stores transcriptions, health data, analytics

**API Endpoints Ready**
- `/api/users/*` - User management
- `/api/health-logs/*` - Health log management  
- `/api/health-logs/analytics/*` - Health analytics

**Example**
```javascript
{
  transcription: "I have a headache...",
  healthData: {
    symptoms: ["headache", "fatigue"],
    severity: 1-10,
    mood: "excellent|good|fair|poor|terrible",
    tags: ["morning", "work-related", etc]
  },
  metadata: {
    duration: seconds,
    confidence: 0-1,
    language: "en"
  }
}
```

**Current analytics include:**
- Mood trends over time
- Common symptoms tracking
- Severity patterns
- Basic health metrics

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install MongoDB (macOS)
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
```

### Running the Backend
```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Generate sample data (after MongoDB is running)
npm run generate-sample-data

# Test basic setup
npm run test-setup
```

### Testing API Endpoints
Server runs on `http://localhost:3000`

```bash
# Check server health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Get all users
curl http://localhost:3000/api/users

# Create a health log
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/health-logs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId":"USER_ID","transcription":"Sample log..."}'
```

## What's Ready vs. What Needs Discussion

### Ready Now
- Database schema and connections
- Basic CRUD operations for users and logs
- Sample data generation
- Health analytics foundation
- API structure for frontend integration

### Needs Team Discussion
- **Log Structure**: Exact fields needed in health logs
- **Historical Data**: How to store and analyze long-term health trends
- **Voice Integration**: How transcription service connects
- **Analytics**: Specific health metrics and reporting needs
- **Authentication**: User login and security requirements

## Integration Points

### For Frontend Team
- API base URL: `http://localhost:3000/api`
- All endpoints return JSON
- Standard HTTP status codes
- Pagination support on list endpoints

### For Voice/Transcription Team
- POST to `/api/health-logs` with transcription text
- Include confidence scores and metadata
- Support for audio file references

### For Analytics Team
- GET `/api/health-logs/analytics/:userId`
- Configurable time periods via query params
- Aggregated health metrics ready for visualization
